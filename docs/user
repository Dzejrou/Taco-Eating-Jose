====================================

About:
======
    TEJ is a 2D platformer written in java. It's goal is to navigate it's
    levels filled with enemies, platforms and coins until you reach
    the end-game portal, which will take you into the next level.

Installing & playing the game:
==============================
    Game installation is done by compiling the Java source codes.
    This can be done by the command "ant compile" (without quotes).
    After the compilation, you can start the game with the command
    "ant run" (again, without quotes) and view the version of java
    required to run with the command "ant version" (... :))

Controls:
=========
    W     - up (when standing on a ladder)
    A     - left
    D     - right
    SPACE - jump

Jumping:
========
    When you jump, the strength of the jump is determined by how long
    do you hold the jump key (up to a certain maximum value). After the jump
    ends, you start falling to the ground, but you can still (altough a bit
    stiffer) maveuvre you character mid-air.

Score:
======
    You earn score by collecting coins (yellow +1, red +5 and blue +20).
    Your score is preserved when you advance to the next level, but reset
    to the value you had upon completition of the last level when you die.
    (Since on the first level you hadn't beaten any level yet, it gets reset
    to 0.) The goal of the game is ofcourse (besides completing it) to
    get the highest possible amount of score you can.
    Note that there are few hidden areas thant contain a bigger amount of coins.

Enemy - Boo:
============
    Boo was designing as an enemy bringing a bit of a strategic aspect into
    the game, inspired by the Super Mario World's Boo character, this Boo
    only moves when you are moving FROM it. It being a bit faster than you
    means in the combination with the numerous small platforms that you have
    to properly plan your movement to bring him down next to you and jump
    on his head (contact with any other part of his body will kill you).

Enemy - Robot:
==============
    The second enemy of this game, the Robot, will be spawned on the ground
    walking between two points (forming a horizontal line). When you come
    close to him, he starts to charge at you, increasing his speed and slowing
    his ability to turn to the other direction.
    Again, the Robot can be killed by jumping on his head (other body parts
    will kill you before you can kill him).

End-game portal:
================
    The end-game portal is represented by a pink two tiles high and one tile
    wide rectangle, which, upon contact with your character, ends the current
    level and either loads the next one or finnishes the game.

Note to fellow players-programmers:
===================================
    If you would like to create an executable jar for this game, you must remember
    to include the libraries slick.jar and lwjgl.jar as well as the natives for
    the platform you want to target (or all). This can be done manually, or with
    the program JarSplice found at http://ninjacave.com/jarsplice, this program
    can also create .exe files. (.exe UNTESTED by me)

Hint:
=====
When in doubt, go right.

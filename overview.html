    <p>
    Taco Eating Jose is a 2D platformer game written in Java using the
    Slick2D (slick.ninjacave.com) library (rendering and base game support).
    In the game, the player tries to navigate 3 (number to change) levels
    filled with platforms, coins and enemies until he reaches the end-game
    portal.

    <p>
    <b>Game loop: </b> <br>
    When the game is started, the JoseMain class' main static method is called,
    which creates an instance of the JoseMain class and calls it's constructor
    (which then calls the parent parent constructor) and then it's run method.
    The run method first calls the init method, which loads the first level.
    Next, the game loop is started. In this loop, the methods update and render
    are called until the program ends. Update updates all characters and objects
    (by calling their update methods) as well as loads new levels if needed.
    Render draws characters on the screen, while objects are rendered through
    the player object (objects are mostly kept in the player class, 
    so that it can easily manipulate them, since they are then unneeded 
    in the JoseMain class).
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Collision detection: </b> <br>
    Collision detection is done with the help of <i>bounding boxes</i>.
    A bounding box is a rectangle around the character's/tile's sprite
    and to detect the collision we check if the two bounding boxes intersect
    (with the help of Rectangle's intersects(Shape other) method)
    to check intersections between two shapes (inherited from the class Shape).
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Debug mode: </b> <br>
    In the JoseMain class, you can set the {@link Jose.src.JoseMain#debug_possible debug_possible}
    variable to true, which will allow you to use the keyboard key G to enter debug mode and the
    key H to leave the debug mode. While in debug mode, you will se bounding boxes of platforms,
    enemies, ladders and the player and also some debug info like framerate, view position,
    player position, player state and direction in the top left corner of the screen.<br>
    <i>Debug controls: </i>
    <ul>
        <li>N - Sets the player's state to debug = no gravity or collisions.</li>
        <li>M - Sets the player's state to normal (standing).</li>
        <li>I - Moves the player up.</li>
        <li>K - Moves the player down.</li>
        <li>J - Moves the player left.</li>
        <li>L - Moves the player right.</li>
        <li>O - Loads the previous level.</li>
        <li>P - Loads the next level.</li>
    </ul> <br>
    Note: You cannot die nor win the level while in debug mode.
    </p>
